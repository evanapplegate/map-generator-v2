# D3.js Map Visualization Bundle

A self-contained, embeddable map visualization generated with D3.js.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: View the Map
1. Extract the zip file
2. Open `index.html` in a browser
3. That's it! The map is fully self-contained

### Option 2: Embed in Your Website

#### Method A: Full Page Embed
1. Copy everything from `index.html` and paste it into your page
2. Done! The map will take up 100% width with a max-width of 960px

#### Method B: Embed in Existing Page
1. Copy these styles to your CSS:
   ```css
   #map {
     width: 100%;
     max-width: 960px;
     margin: 0 auto;
   }
   ```

2. Add this div where you want the map:
   ```html
   <div id="map"></div>
   ```

3. Add D3.js to your page's `<head>`:
   ```html
   <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>
   ```

4. Copy everything between <script> tags from `index.html` and paste it before your closing `</body>` tag

## What's in the Bundle
- `index.html`: Working demo with embedded map
- `data.json`: Raw data (GeoJSON + configuration)

## Customization
- Edit colors in the `config` object
- Modify styles in the `<style>` tag
- Adjust map size by changing `width` and `height` variables
